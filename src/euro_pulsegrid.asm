; CYCLE_HOTPATH_BLACK_LOCK
; =====================================================================
; EURO PULSEGRID V9.0 RETINAL CONTRAST HOTPATH BLACK LOCK / EURO PULSEGRID V3.9 STARPTR ROI
; V9.0_RETINAL_CONTRAST_HOTPATH_BLACK_LOCK
; - Adds retinal contrast/edge-completion cue: near/far opponent micro-pairs that exploit
;   simultaneous contrast + closure, phase-locked to cube/body motion and kept x<=19.
; - Adds final perceptual-stack gate call only inside existing V8.7 camera/perception hotpath.
; - Preserves no-stars/no-border, black background, no-wrap locks and SID/audio timing.
; V8.9_FOVEAL_HOTPATH_BLACK_LOCK
; V8.8_MOTION_GROUPGATE_BLACK_LOCK: second hotpath pass after V8.7.
; - Keeps no-stars/no-border/black background/no-wrap locks.
; - Adds one broad activity gate around the V6.4..V7.6 rigid-body motion stack.
; - Idle frames avoid thirteen extra JSR/RTS pairs and repeated local predicates.
; - Active musical/transient frames still draw the full phase-correct 3D motion stack.
; Commodore 64 / ACME assembler
; PAL 50Hz KERNAL-vector safe raster IRQ, STEPFRAMES=2, ZP ROI max closure
; A minor / hands-up eurodance arrangement
; V4.4_VOLUMETRIC_DEPTH_FX: volumetric under-shadow, rear fog veil, chroma fringe.
; V4.9_PHASELOCK_PREFLASH_FX: fixes V4.8 perceived lag with one-frame-only pre-arm, immediate stale-pre clear, and faster visual pulse decay.
; V8.2_CAMERA_SETTLE_BLACK_LOCK_FX
; - Adds final phase-correct camera settle/body-lock cue after V8.1 camera inertia.
; - Low-noise x<=24/y 10..15 anchors reduce dot-drift and make the cube read
;   as one stable rotating body while preserving black background/no-wrap locks.
; V8.1_CAMERA_INERTIA_BLACK_LOCK_FX
; - Adds final damped camera-inertia body cue after V8.0 camera spline.
; - Keeps V8.0 camera spline black lock intact and preserves all no-wrap guards.
; V8.0_CAMERA_SPLINE_BLACK_LOCK_FX
; - Adds a final phase-correct camera-spline body cue after V7.7 body projection.
;   The points form a small centre/near/far stabilizer that moves as one rigid
;   body with vis_frame, never star_phase, and stays deep inside x<=26.
; - Tightens older residual colour/frame lookups so depth dots/details/accent
;   colours use cached star_color_index and accent motion follows cube phase
;   instead of starfield shimmer.  Black background and no-wrap locks preserved.
; V7.9_UPLOADED_FIX_MERGE_BLACK_LOCK
; - Merges safe fixes from the uploaded V7.8/V3.9 ASM: cached star_color_index
;   reused by all colour-cycle lookups, preserving the uploaded star/colour ROI
;   improvement.  Kept the newer hard viewport guards, full-width clear,
;   right-edge scrub and black-background lock from V7.8 so the uploaded
;   no-guard optimization cannot reintroduce right-edge wrapping.
; V7.8_BLACK_BACKGROUND_LOCK_FX
; - Keeps the VIC background hard black every visual frame.  The FX-band and
;   full-screen clears now use black colour RAM for blank cells, and a final
;   black-background lock is called after drawing/edge scrub.  No SID/audio
;   timing change; cube/effect pixels still use their own colours, but the
;   empty backdrop and right-edge sealed cells remain black.
; V7.6_ORBITAL_STABILITY_BODY_FX
; - Adds phase-correct orbital-stability body anchors as a final low-noise
;   stabilizer after motion convergence.  It traces an inner body diagonal and
;   counter-diagonal with eased positions so the cube reads as one solid 3D
;   object.  Locked to vis_frame with only one-frame music lead/pre; no
;   star_phase, no SID-tail lag, and all points stay inside x<=28.
; V7.3_TEMPORAL_COHERENCE_MOTION_FX
; - Adds phase-correct temporal-coherence anchors as the final glue between
;   coherent-body, eased-vector, centroid and inertia cues.  It also removes
;   star_phase from the vertex-sparkle frame selector so hot vertices follow
;   cube rotation instead of starfield shimmer.  All new points are x<=30,
;   tail-free, and locked to vis_frame plus the one-frame music lead/pre only.
; V7.2_COHERENT_BODY_MOTION_FX
; - Adds phase-correct coherent-body motion anchors that tie the centroid,
;   eased-vector, inertia and face-normal cues into one perceived rigid body.
;   The path is deliberately slower/eased and centre-weighted, so movement feels
;   like a correct 3D cube rotation instead of independent shimmer. Locked to
;   vis_frame with only one-frame music lead/pre; no star_phase, no SID-tail lag,
;   and all points stay inside x<=30.
; V7.1_EASED_VECTOR_MOTION_FX
; - Adds phase-correct eased-vector motion anchors that bridge centroid/orbit
;   movement with a tiny eased lead/return path.  This reduces robotic stepping
;   and makes the cube rotation read as one continuous 3D body.  Locked to
;   vis_frame with only one-frame music lead/pre; no star_phase, no SID-tail lag,
;   and all points stay inside x<=31.
; V7.0_CENTROID_MOTION_LOCK_FX
; - Adds phase-correct centroid/axis-lock anchors between the orbit, rails,
;   hinge, spline, normal and inertia cues.  The points trace the perceived
;   centre-of-mass and front/back axis of the cube, making rotation feel more
;   mechanically correct and less like independent sparkles.  Locked to
;   vis_frame with only one-frame music lead/pre; no star_phase, no tail lag,
;   and all points stay inside x<=31.
; V6.9_INERTIA_NORMAL_DEPTH_FX
; - Adds phase-correct depth-inertia anchors: a tiny lead/trail pair that
;   follows the face-normal/orbit/rail stack with coherent one-frame inertia.
;   This makes cube rotation feel smoother and more physical without star_phase
;   shimmer, envelope-tail lag, or right-edge risk.  All points stay inside x<=32.
; V6.8_DEPTH_NORMAL_MOTION_FX
; - Adds phase-correct depth-normal vector anchors.  These are tiny front/back
;   normal cues that move on a coherent 16-frame path locked to vis_frame,
;   offset from the spline/rail/hinge stack.  They strengthen the 3D illusion
;   by showing which face is turning toward the viewer, without star_phase
;   shimmer, SID-tail lag, or right-edge risk.  All points stay inside x<=32.
; V6.7_MOTION_SPLINE_DEPTH_FX
; - Adds phase-correct motion-spline guide points between the orbit/rail/hinge
;   cues.  These use interpolated frame tables locked to vis_frame and avoid
;   star_phase/tail jitter, making the cube depth motion read smoother and more
;   physically coherent while staying inside x<=32.
; V6.6_PHASE_HINGE_MOTION_FX
; - Adds phase-hinge front/back anchor motion: the front corner cue and rear
;   counter-cue move in opposite-but-matched phases, making the cube rotation
;   read as hinge/perspective depth rather than just extra sparkles.  It is
;   locked to vis_frame only and stays inside x<=33.
; V6.5_KINEMATIC_DEPTH_LOCK_FX
; - Adds phase-locked kinematic depth rails and counter-motion anchors.  The
;   rails are locked to vis_frame/inverse phase only, never star_phase, so
;   they move as a coherent 3D structure instead of random shimmer.
; V6.4_PHASE_CORRECT_3D_MOTION_FX
; V6.3_INNER_DEPTH_WEAVE_FX: adds a small transient/chorus-gated inner weave inside x<=33 for extra depth while preserving the V6.2/V6.1 no-wrap viewport lock.
; V6.2_SAFE_WIDE_DEPTH_SNAP_FX: keeps the hard x<=34 live viewport, then adds an inward-only safe-wide depth rim so the cube regains width without touching the risky right edge.
; V6.1_INNER_VIEWPORT_SNAP_FX: clamps all live cube/tail/shadow/detail/star writes to x<=34 and scrubs columns 35..39 after draw.
; V6.0_TRUE_VIEWPORT_LOCK_FX: hard clamps main cube/shadow/tail/beat-scale writes to x<=34 before plotting, preserving V5.9 post-draw scrub.
; V5.9_EDGE_SEAL_DEPTH_POLISH_FX: final post-draw right-edge scrub + safe center polish, eliminating late wrap/bleed from any source.
; V5.8_HARD_RIGHT_EDGE_NOWRAP_FIX: full-width FX band clear + hard x>=35 overlay guard to eliminate right-edge wrap/stale bleed.
; V5.7_NOWRAP_FLASH_CLOSURE_FX: legacy nowrap flash closure retained, now hardened by V5.8.
; - Fixes visible right/bottom wrapping by clamping all flash/detail overlay
;   tables to a conservative safe viewport and adding a cheap detail-plot
;   runtime guard.  Main cube/audio/SID timing unchanged.
; - Light/scanline/rim/prism/crystal/apex/neon flash stack remains
;   peak/pre-only and V4.6 layer-order experiment remains reverted.
; V5.6_NEON_FOCUS_SNAP_CLOSURE_FX: adds tiny center-focus neon pulse after apex; peak/pre-only, no late tail, no audio timing change.
; V5.5_PERFECT_SNAP_CLOSURE_FX: final minimal apex flash + stricter peak governor; no layer-order experiment, no SID timing change.
; V5.4_CRYSTAL_SNAP_FINAL_FX: adds peak/pre-only crystal edge caustics after prism halo, keeps V5.2 no-late-flash closure.
; V5.3_PRISM_SNAP_POLISH_FX: adds peak/pre-only prism halo + colour snap, tightens sparkle gating, preserves V5.2 no-late-flash closure.
; V5.2_FINAL_SNAPLOCK_CLOSURE_FX: clamps late carry-over frames, makes all light/strobe FX peak/pre-only, and hard-clears phase lead after draw; no second-frame late sparkle.
; V5.1_SNAPLOCK_MICROSTROBE_FX: keeps V5.0 peak-only gates but removes prefetch light-gate tail and adds a tiny transient strobe for tighter perceived beat lock.
; V5.0_TIGHTLOCK_LIGHTSYNC_FX: removes tail-biased flash gates, adds a short visual_light_gate peak latch, and phase-leads flash tables for tighter music lock.
; V4.8_MUSIC_SYNC_PREFLASH_FX: V4.7 light flash stack plus visual trigger pulses and one-IRQ preflash.
; V4.7_LIGHT_FLASH_DEPTH_FX: reverted V4.6 layered order, adds beat light flash/flare overlays.
; V4.5_HOLO_PARALLAX_DEPTH_FX: rear tunnel rings, vertex sparkle, bass parallax beams.
; V4.3_PERFECT_DEPTH_ILLUSION: floor-grid shadow, z-slice silhouette, lens glints.
; V4.2_SHADOW_DEPTH_ILLUSION: cast shadow, back-face occlusion, parallax depth glow.
; V4.1_DETAILMAX_COLOUR_FX: adds depth dots, animated accent seams, 8-step colour cycles.
; V4.0_DETAILCOLOUR_FX: inner cube ribs, corner glints, colour-cycling star/detail FX.
; V3.9_STARPTR_ROI: v3.8 plus precomputed starfield row pointers.
; V3.8_BEATSCALE_GATE_ROI
; V3.7_ZP_ROI_MAX
; V3.6_STEPTOGGLE_TAILGATE
; V3.5_FLASHCACHE_CLOSURE: v3.4 lean IRQ plus inlined flash-color cache.
; V3.4_LEAN_IRQ_CLOSURE: v3.3 technical max plus lean IRQ final placement/hardening.
; V3.3_TECHNICAL_MAX: absolute clear + deterministic drum dispatch + v2.9 hotpath closure.

; V7.3 phase-correct temporal-coherence anchors.  Three centre-weighted pairs
; per frame: bridge, axis-memory, and near/rear blend.  It fills the gap between
; coherent-body and eased-vector cues so the cube reads as one continuous
; rotation, not frame-by-frame dots.  All points x<=30/y 9..16.
